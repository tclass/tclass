> Hey Mr. Ahmad, listen up what I say    
> we want to thank you, I hope it's ok       
> oh boy oh boy, did we go for a ride   
> did so many things, even at night     
>   
> sebastian and kevin, tuukka and me   
> anni and phillip and anthony   
> and man of the hour, birthday kid at least   
> this was our trip, in the not so far east   

> so many bad meals, most places we tried    
> even fried schnitzel, so bad I could've cried   
> just thinking about it, I start to shiver   
> my doctor just told me, I need a new liver   

> second biggest building, wow what a letdown   
> the country was fine, now it's going to shutdown     
> watching some band, drinking a beer   
> talking with friends, laughing to tear   

> you're not normal dude, you are amazing   
> this trip was awesome, everyone made it blazing   
> waiting for the next one, take me wherever   
> we stay by your side, asspats forever
