I would call myself an "cold shower evangelist". I discovered the whole cold showering in 2016 and did it for some months.
Then after a shoulder injury I stopped doing it and only started in the beginning of 2017 with a daily cold shower.
Why on earth would I do such a thing? Is this some kind of "how to save money as a student" thing or a "this is the
secret of eternal live, nobody tells you". No it's not, there are plenty of articles on the internet, that will tell you
something about scientific facts of cold showers. I think 20% is really true and there are some good parts, but if
you are searching for the secret weapon that will fix all your problems, please search somewhere else.
Cold showers are hard to do for many people and everyone would be a little bit afraid if he or she would want to do it
for the first time. But for me the upsides are very clear and have nothing to do with some bro-science bullshit. 
 
 ## They
 - raising your heart rate and so you feel awake and fresh afterwards
 - will be a challenge every morning, it's a "getting out of your comfort zone" kind of behaviour you do every morning
 - will prevent you from getting sick

 as you see above, there is only one point that could be bro-science and that's the last one. If you are interested in the
 topic, you should read a little bit about it or visit [reddit/r/coldshower](https://reddit.com/r/coldshower). But beware
 you have to choose your own way and there is so much of pseudo-scientific stuff floating around, that it can be sometimes
 hard to choose what to believe. In the end you have to try it out and decide if that is something you can benefit
 from or not. This blog post will remind me, that I started 2017 with permanent cold showers, maybe I will give an update 
at the end of the year and see if I could make it the whole year.
